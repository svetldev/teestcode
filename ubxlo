u-blox receivers calculate the multipath index using metrics derived from signal quality measurements, particularly by analyzing the shape and stability of the signal correlation function over time. Multipath effects occur when satellite signals reach the receiver via multiple paths, typically due to reflection off surfaces like buildings, water, or the ground, leading to errors in position estimates. Here's how u-blox receivers likely compute the multipath index:

Key Concepts in Multipath Index Calculation
Correlation Function Analysis:

The receiver measures the signal correlation function, which represents the alignment of the incoming signal with an ideal replica of the satellite signal.
Multipath distorts the shape of this correlation function, introducing asymmetry or broadening its peak.
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):

SNR indicates the strength of the received signal compared to background noise. Multipath can either increase or decrease the SNR depending on constructive or destructive interference.
Large SNR fluctuations over time can indicate multipath effects.
Signal Amplitude and Phase Stability:

Multipath introduces variations in the signal amplitude and phase. By monitoring these variations over time, the receiver can infer the presence and severity of multipath.
Pseudorange Residuals:

Multipath affects the accuracy of pseudorange measurements. Large, consistent residuals in the navigation solution after applying corrections may indicate multipath.
Multipath Index Calculation in u-blox Receivers
u-blox likely uses a proprietary algorithm to compute a multipath index based on the above metrics. While the exact implementation details are not publicly documented, the process generally includes the following steps:

Correlation Peak Analysis:

Compare the early, prompt, and late correlation values from the signal tracking loop.
Multipath is inferred from distortions in the correlation peak (e.g., a broadened or asymmetrical peak).
SNR Stability:

Analyze short-term and long-term SNR trends for fluctuations.
Compute a stability metric to quantify variations attributable to multipath.
Residual Analysis:

After applying satellite and receiver corrections, analyze the residuals of pseudorange measurements.
Residual patterns deviating from expected noise levels are attributed to multipath.
Elevation Angle Weighting:

Weight multipath likelihood by satellite elevation angle, as low-elevation satellites are more prone to multipath effects.
Index Normalization:

Combine the metrics into a normalized multipath index, typically ranging from 0 (no multipath) to 1 (severe multipath).
Applications of the Multipath Index
Positioning Quality: A high multipath index alerts users or algorithms to potential degradation in positioning accuracy.
Exclusion of Satellites: Satellites with high multipath indices may be excluded from the navigation solution.
Quality Monitoring: Multipath indices can be logged and monitored over time to assess environmental conditions affecting GPS performance.
u-blox Documentation on Multipath
u-blox provides some metrics related to multipath under their signal quality monitoring features in protocols like UBX-NAV-SAT and UBX-MON-SAT. These include:

C/N0 (Carrier-to-Noise Ratio): Indicates signal strength.
Pseudorange Residuals: Highlight errors in range measurements.
Tracking Status Flags: May indicate degraded tracking due to multipath.
You can retrieve these metrics via the UBX protocol for further analysis if you are using a u-blox device. However, the proprietary multipath index calculation itself is embedded in the receiver firmware and not explicitly disclosed.
